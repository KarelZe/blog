If you ask Sandi Thom I was probably born too late, ’cause Markus was raised up in the 90/00’s in Germany.

Ever since I have enjoyed solving problems and building things out of wood in my dad’s workshop. These were the main reasons why I’ve founded my webpage www.markusbilz.com. I’d like to share my latest experiments, code,  renders, paintings, 3d prints and doodles in the field of art, cg and science with you.

Besides from this I enjoy cooking and programming.

Thank you for visiting my website! If you have any questions about me or the posted content feel free to post a comment or write me an E-mail to: mail@markusbilz.com.
