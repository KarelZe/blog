If you ask Sandi Thom I was probably born too late, cause Alexander Bilz was raised up in the 90/00’s in southern Germany. Ever since I have enjoyed solving problems, building and tinkering in my dad’s workshop. These were the main reasons why I’ve founded the successful blog called Quaintproject. On this blog, I am sharing my latest experiments, code snippets, and doodles in the field of Raspberry Pi, IT in general, FOSS, CG and 3D Printing with you. My main goal is both to inspire but to also help with common problems. I am also contributing to quaintproject ’s GitHub projects on a regular basis. My weapons of choice for programming are C#, Python, and JavaScript.

I've been working in IT since 2011. I started off with earning a degree as an IT Management Assistant and worked as a First&Second Level IT Specialist for almost three years. After that, I decided to participate in the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX) which gave me the great opportunity to work as an IT technician for the University of Alaska South East in Sitka. Right now I am in a programme of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University which combines on-the-job training and academic studies. My major is Computer Science.

In my spare time, I try to spend as much time traveling to remote places. Though, I also enjoy simply going hiking and fishing in Bavaria. Lately, I've also started writing about my travel experiences. Feel free to check out my posts.
