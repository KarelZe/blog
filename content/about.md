Hi, I'm Markus Bilz.👋

I'm passionate about machine learning and deep learning, currently focusing on vision-language models and synthetic data generation. My goal is always readable, performant code.🚀

After graduating from KIT, I joined Atruvia to develop document AI solutions.

In my spare time, you'll find me strolling, gravel biking or traveling. One of my greatest dreams would be to set foot on [Jan Mayen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Mayen).❄️
